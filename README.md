# Concurrent-programming

Concurrent programming is a programming paradigm that deals with the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks or processes that can occur in an overlapping manner in time. Instead of running a program sequentially, where each instruction is executed one after the other, concurrent programming allows various parts of the program to run in parallel.

In this repository you can find three different works that solve different "toy" problems related to this concept of concurrent programming. Concepts are internalized through different levels of abstraction.


Different programming languages have been used, such as Java, Ada and Go.
